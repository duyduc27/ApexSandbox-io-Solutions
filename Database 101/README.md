Duc just wants to solve some puzzles.

## Database 101
Note: This problem requires installation of a packaged data model. [Install package in your org](https://gaudan2-dev-ed.develop.my.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5f000000Gx6CAAS) and [read up on the data model](https://gist.github.com/maujood/9bca1e95a9fe39b1cb881a116873d83e)

### Insert Student
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/126

The method  `insertStudent`  takes as input strings  `name`  and  `email`, and returns a record ID. Implement the method to insert an  `apxio__Student__c`  record with the  `Name`  and  `apxio__Email__c`  fields filled out, and return the  `Id`  of the new record.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c`

### Insert Course
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/132

The method  `insertCourse`  takes as input strings  `name`  and  `details`, an integer  `credits`, and returns a record ID. Implement the method to insert a  `apxio__Course__c`  record with the  `Name`  and  `apxio__Course_Details__c`  and  `apxio__Credits__c`  fields filled out, and return the  `Id`  of the new record.

Note that`apxio__Credits__c`  is a restricted picklist with valid values  `1`,  `2`,  `3`, and  `4`. If an invalid value is provided for this picklist, return  `null`.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Course__c`
-   `apxio__Course__c.apxio__Course_Details__c`
-   `apxio__Course__c.apxio__Credits__c`

### Register Student
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/127

The method  `registerStudent`  takes as input strings  `name`,  `phone`  and  `email`, and returns a string. Implement the method to insert an  `apxio__Student__c`  record with the  `Name`,  `apxio__Phone__c`  and  `apxio__Email__c`  fields filled out, and return the autogenerated  `apxio__Registration_Number__c`  of the new record.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Phone__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Registration_Number__c`

### Active Students
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/128

Implement the method selectActiveStudents that returns a list of all  `apxio__Student__c`  records with  `apxio__Active__c`  field checked. Make sure the students have a value in the Id and Name fields.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Active__c`

### Unreachable Students
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/130

Implement the method  `selectUnreachableStudents`  that queries for and returns a list of all active  `apxio__Student__c`  records that are unreachable because they are missing both an email and a phone number. Make sure to include the  `Id`  and  `Name`  fields in the result. The returned list should be sorted A-Z on Name.

For example, given the following list of students in the database:

| Student Name | Phone | Email  | Active |
| ------| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|Brian Crumley | (791)232-997 | brian@apexsandbox.io | true |
| Paulina Smith | | | true |
| Azeem Khan | | ak@apexsandbox.io | true|

The method should return a list with a single record for Paulina Smith

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Active__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Phone__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Registration_Number__c`

### Students Missing Info
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/129

Implement the method  `selectStudentsWithoutContactInfo`  that queries for and returns a list of all active  `apxio__Student__c`  records that are missing an email, phone, or both. Make sure to include the  `Id`  and  `Name`  fields in the result. The returned list should be sorted A-Z on Name.

For example, given the following list of students in the database:
| Student Name | Phone | Email  | Active |
| ------| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|Brian Crumley | (791)232-997 | brian@apexsandbox.io | true |
| Paulina Smith | | | true |
| Azeem Khan | | ak@apexsandbox.io | true|

The method should return a list containing Azeem Khan at index 0 and Paulina Smith at index 1

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Active__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Phone__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Registration_Number__c`

### Course and Class
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/131

The method  `createCourseAndClass`  takes as input string parameters  `courseName`  and  `description`, and returns void. Provide an implementation of the method that first inserts a  `apxio__Course__c`  record with the provided name and description (if provided) copied into the  `Name`  and  `apxio__Course_Details__c`  fields, and then inserts a child  `apxio__Class__c`  record with the same name and description copied into the  `Name`  and  `apxio__Description__c`  fields.

There is, however, a difference between the course details and description fields on the two objects. While the  `apxio__Course__c.apxio__Course_Details__c`  has type Rich Text capable of storing thousands of characters,  `apxio__Class__c.apxio__Description__c`  can only store a maximum of 255 characters. Make sure to truncate the description to 255 characters before adding it to your  `apxio__Class__c`  record. You can assume that the provided description will never be too large for the rich text field.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Course__c`
-   `apxio__Course__c.apxio__Course_Details__c`
-   `apxio__Class__c`
-   `apxio__Class__c.apxio__Course__c`
-   `apxio__Class__c.apxio__Description__c`

### Student List
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/133

The method  `insertStudents`  takes as input two lists of strings  `studentNames`  and  `studentEmails`. The two lists will always have the same size, with  `studentNames[i]`  and  `studentEmails[i]`  (for any in-range value of  `i`) representing a student's name and email.

Write an implementation of the method that creates  `apxio__Student__c`  records for each entry in the lists with the  `Name`  and  `apxio__Email__c`  fields filled out.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c`

### Class from Course
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/134

Implement the method  `classFromCourse`  that takes as input a string  `courseName`, creates an  `apxio__Class__c`  record associated with the course named  `courseName`, and returns the  `Id`  of the new record. The new class should have the same  `Name`  as the course.

You should not create a new  `apxio__Course__c`  record. The new class should be linked to the course that already exists in the database. In case no course with the given name is found, do not create any class record and return null.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Course__c`
-   `apxio__Class__c`
-   `apxio__Class__c.apxio__Course__c`

### Enroll Students
https://www.apexsandbox.io/problem/135

Implement the method  `enrollStudents`  that takes as input a list of strings  `emails`  and a string  `className`. The method should enroll all students with the provided emails into a class with the given name by creating  `apxio__Class_Enrollment__c`  records.

Note that  `apxio__Student__c`  and  `apxio__Class__c`  records already exist in the database.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

-   `apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c`
-   `apxio__Class__c`
-   `apxio__Class_Enrollment__c`
-   `apxio__Class_Enrollment__c.apxio__Student__c`
-   `apxio__Class_Enrollment__c.apxio__Offered_Class__c`
